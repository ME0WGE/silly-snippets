# Silly Snippets

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides a collection of _somewhat_ useful code snippets to enhance my development experience. This project was made purely for my needs, therefore it's adapted exclusively for my coding habits. _Prefix naming might be weird and inefficient._

## Features

- **Silly Code Snippets**: A curated collection of practical code snippets
- **Ultra Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with VS Code's snippet system (VSCode try not to break _challenge_)
- **Customizable**: Add your own silly snippets to the collection (why am I writing to myself?)
- **Cross-Language Support**: Snippets available for multiple programming languages

## Supported Languages
